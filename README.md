# hass-lovelace-netatmo-security-events-card
A card layout for the Home Assistant theme Lovelace which renders the Netatmo Security event list, displaying event types and linking to the recorded video when available.

(work in progress)

⚠️ Note: at this point I can only get the card to work with the credentials authentication type, meaning the username and password have to be stored in the card's yaml configuration, which is obviously a security issue (use at your own risk!). I would love for this to work with the Netatmo integration authentication. Any ideas on this are welcome!
